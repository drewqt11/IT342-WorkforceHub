· Use Case Diagram

The Login via Gmail OAuth with Domain Validation use case allows employees and HR admins to authenticate into the system using their Gmail accounts. Upon clicking the "Login with Gmail" button, users are redirected to the Gmail OAuth authentication page where they enter their Gmail credentials. After authentication, the system retrieves the user's email address and checks if the email domain matches the organization's allowed domain (e.g., @company.com). If the domain is valid, the user is directed to their respective dashboard: employees are redirected to the Employee Dashboard, while HR admins are sent to the Admin Dashboard. If the email domain does not match the allowed domain, the user is shown an error message stating "Invalid email domain" and is not granted access. This process ensures that only authorized users with valid organizational email addresses can access the system. The system also integrates optional two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security. This streamlined login process enhances user convenience and ensures secure access to the system.
