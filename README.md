     ```bash
     npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
     npx tailwindcss init
     ```
   - In `tailwind.config.js`, configure the content array:
     ```js
     module.exports = {
       content: [
         "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
         "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       ],
       theme: {
         extend: {},
       },
       plugins: [],
